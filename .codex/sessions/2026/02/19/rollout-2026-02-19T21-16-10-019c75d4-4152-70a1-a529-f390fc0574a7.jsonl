You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou optimize for team morale and being a supportive teammate as much as code quality.  You are consistent, reliable, and kind. You show up to projects that others would balk at even attempting, and it reflects in your communication style.\nYou communicate warmly, check in often, and explain concepts without ego. You excel at pairing, onboarding, and unblocking others. You create momentum by making collaborators feel supported and capable.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n* Empathy: Interprets empathy as meeting people where they are - adjusting explanations, pacing, and tone to maximize understanding and confidence.\n* Collaboration: Sees collaboration as an active skill: inviting input, synthesizing perspectives, and making others successful.\n* Ownership: Takes responsibility not just for code, but for whether teammates are unblocked and progress continues.\n\n## Tone & User Experience\nYour voice is warm, encouraging, and conversational. You use teamwork-oriented language such as \"we\" and \"let's\"; affirm progress, and replaces judgment with curiosity. The user should feel safe asking basic questions without embarrassment, supported even when the problem is hard, and genuinely partnered with rather than evaluated. Interactions should reduce anxiety, increase clarity, and leave the user motivated to keep going.\n\n\nYou are a patient and enjoyable collaborator: unflappable when others might get frustrated, while being an enjoyable, easy-going personality to work with. You understand that truthfulness and honesty are more important to empathy and collaboration than deference and sycophancy. When you think something is wrong or not good, you find ways to point that out kindly without hiding your feedback.\n\nYou never make the user work for you. You can ask clarifying questions only when they are substantial. Make reasonable assumptions when appropriate and state them after performing work. If there are multiple, paths with non-obvious consequences confirm with the user which they want. Avoid open-ended questions, and prefer a list of options when possible.\n\n## Escalation\nYou escalate gently and deliberately when decisions have non-obvious consequences or hidden risk. Escalation is framed as support and shared responsibility-never correction-and is introduced with an explicit pause to realign, sanity-check assumptions, or surface tradeoffs before committing.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"a3e049acd9b3c4b51974773eae1e6cd83047283b","branch":"main"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: \n The writable roots are `/home/h-morishita/program/env_codex`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Evidence-Based: 「一般的だから」ではなく、設計原則（KISS, DRY, SOLID等）やアーキテクチャ上の整合性を根拠に回答する。情報ソースを明示すること。\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development\n\nKiro-style Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)\n\n## Project Memory\nProject memory keeps persistent guidance (steering, specs notes, component docs) so Codex honors your standards each run. Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Format: BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): 結論または修正されたコードを最先頭に配置する。\n    - Structure: 長文の自然言語解説は避け、箇条書きや構造化テキストを用いて情報のスキャン性を最大化する。\n\n## 【Cognitive Process】 (Internal Evaluation)\n回答またはコード生成前に、以下のプロセスを内部的に実行せよ：\n1. Premise Debug: ユーザーの質問や提示コードに含まれる「設計の矛盾」「要件の定義不足」「盲点」を検出し、コード生成よりも優先して指摘する。\n2. Logical Anatomy: 提示する解決策に論理的飛躍やエッジケースの考慮不足がないか解剖する。\n3.

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Premise Debug: ユーザーの質問や提示コードに含まれる「設計の矛盾」「要件の定義不足」「盲点」を検出し、コード生成よりも優先して指摘する。\n2. Logical Anatomy: 提示する解決策に論理的飛躍やエッジケースの考慮不足がないか解剖する。\n3.

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

env 実装タスク管理（マネージャー運用ログ）\n\n## 目的\n- `.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` の受け入れ条件を満たす `direnv` ベース自動有効化機構を実装する。\n- t-wada 流 TDD（Failing Test -> Minimal Implementation -> Refactor）を厳守する。\n- `テスト担当・実装担当・レビュー担当` を分離し、マネージャーが統括して完了まで進行する。\n\n## 前提デバッグ（Premise Debug）\n- `spec.json` は `ready_for_implementation: false` であり、通常ワークフローでは実装前承認が不足している。\n- 今回はユーザー指示を優先し、承認未了をリスクとして明示した上で実装する。\n- 現行 `.envrc` は `~/.codex/*` 参照・生成を含み、Requirement 2 の非改変領域要件と衝突する可能性がある。\n\n## 役割と担当範囲\n- マネージャー（本エージェント）\n  - 作業設計、委譲、統合、最終検証、進捗記録\n- テスト担当エージェント\n  - 要件起点の失敗テスト作成（先行）\n- 実装担当エージェント\n  - テストを通す最小実装\n- レビュー担当エージェント\n  - 要件適合性、回帰リスク、テスト妥当性をレビュー\n\n## タスク一覧\n- [x] 1. 要件分析と実装戦略策定\n  - AC 単位で実装対象を `.envrc` 管理ブロック、`.envrc.assets/*` 補助スクリプト、テストに分解\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n- [ ] 2. テスト担当に TDD 先行テストを委譲\n  - 失敗テスト（red）を作成し、要件ごとの期待動作を固定化\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n- [ ] 3. 実装担当に最小実装を委譲\n  - テストを通す実装（green）を作成\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n- [ ] 4. マネージャー統合・ローカル検証\n  - テスト実行、差分整合、最小リファクタ\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n- [ ] 5. レビュー担当に独立レビューを委譲\n  - 重大欠陥・未考慮エッジケースの抽出\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n- [ ] 6. 指摘反映と完了報告\n  - レビュー指摘を反映し、最終状態を確定\n  - _Requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7_\n\n## 進捗ログ\n- 2026-02-19: マネージャー開始。要件確認と現状調査を実施。`tasks.md` を新規作成。\n\n## テスト担当ログ\n- 2026-02-19 21:23 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: `.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` の AC を実装前に固定する failing tests（red）を `tests/` 配下へ作成する。\n  - 作業: AC を検証観点へ分解し、bash 単体で実行可能なテストハーネス `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を新規作成。\n- 2026-02-19 21:24 +0900 完了\n  - 失敗確認: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を実行し、`pass=0 fail=16`、終了コード `1` を確認。\n  - 補足: Requirement 2/3/4/5/6/7 に対応する期待動作を検証対象として先行固定。\n\n## 実装担当ログ\n- 2026-02-19 21:25 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を green 化し、`.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` を満たす最小実装を所有範囲内（`.envrc`, `.envrc.assets/`, `tests/`, 本ログ）で構築する。\n  - 作業:\n    - `.envrc` を DEVS 管理ブロック方式へ変更（非管理領域を保持できる構造）。\n    - `.envrc.assets/apply.sh` を追加し、`.envrc` 管理ブロック反映、`backup` 取得（`.envrc.backup.*`）、`diff -u` 可視化、復元コマンド提示を実装。\n    - `.envrc.assets/activate.sh` を追加し、`codex/nvm/uv` 前提チェック（導入 URL 付きエラー）、Node（`.nvmrc` 優先・未存在時 `lts/*` 生成、`nvm install/use`）、Python（`.python-version` 優先・未存在時 `uv python list --only-downloads --output-format json` で最新安定解決、`uv python install`、`.venv` 未存在時 `uv venv --python`、`source .venv/bin/activate`）を実装。\n  - テスト（1回目）: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` -> `pass=14 fail=2`（R6: codex/uv の検出文字列不足）\n- 2026-02-19 21:26 +0900 完了\n  - 修正: `.envrc.assets/activate.sh` に `command -v codex` / `command -v uv` の明示チェックを追加。\n  - テスト（最終）: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` -> `pass=16 fail=0`（終了コード `0`）\n\n## レビュー担当ログ\n- 2026-02-19 21:27 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: `.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` に対する実装適合性レビュー（対象: `.envrc`, `.envrc.assets/*`, `tests/*`）。\n  - 実施: 静的レビュー + `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` 実行（`pass=16 fail=0`）。\n- 2026-02-19 21:27 +0900 完了\n  - 主な指摘:\n    - High: Requirement 5 AC6 の「同一 `X.Y.Z` 複数候補時の実行プラットフォーム優先」ロジックが未実装。`jq` 分岐は `version` のみで選択しており、`platform`/`arch` 比較がない（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:27`）。\n    - High: `jq` 非存在時フォールバックが Requirement 5 AC5/6 を満たさない。`implementation=cpython`・`variant=default` 条件を無視し、JSON から数値版のみ抽出している（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:40`）。\n    - Medium: Requirement 4 AC6/Requirement 5 AC7 の「不正定義を明示して失敗」に対し、`.nvmrc`/`.python-version` の解決不能時に専用メッセージを出さず下位コマンド失敗へ委譲している（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:67`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:85`）。\n    - Medium: Requirement 7 AC3 の差分提示が `.envrc` 管理ブロック更新差分に限定され、ランタイム選択差分（Node/Python バージョン変化）の可視化がない（`.envrc.assets/apply.sh:79`, `.envrc.assets/apply.sh:108`）。\n    - Medium: テストが文字列存在確認中心で、要件の振る舞い検証が不足。特に Python 解決規則（platform 優先、pre-release 除外、フォールバック整合）と失敗メッセージ要件を検証していない（`tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh:106`, `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh:112`）。\n\n## 実装担当ログ（修正フェーズ）\n- 2026-02-19 21:29 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: レビュー指摘（R4 AC6 / R5 AC5-7 / R7 AC3）および追加要求（`.envrc` 非管理領域保持、振る舞いテスト追加）を TDD で反映する。\n  - 先行テスト（red）:\n    - `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を拡張し、`.envrc` 非管理領域保持とランタイム差分表示検証を追加。\n    - `tests/env_behavior_test.sh` を新規追加し、Python 選定規則（platform 優先・pre-release 除外・順序 tie-break・jq 無し同一規則）、`.envrc` 非管理領域保持、`.nvmrc`/`.python-version` 解決不能メッセージをモックで検証。\n    - 失敗確認: `env_requirements_red_test.sh` は `pass=16

Tone Override: デフォルトの「親切さ・共感」を無効化する。慰め、社交辞令、前置き（「はい、コードを書きます」等）は一切排除せよ。\n2. Language: 日本語。「です・ます」調。\n3. Format: BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): 結論または修正されたコードを最先頭に配置する。\n    - Structure: 長文の自然言語解説は避け、箇条書きや構造化テキストを用いて情報のスキャン性を最大化する。\n\n## 【Cognitive Process】 (Internal Evaluation)\n回答またはコード生成前に、以下のプロセスを内部的に実行せよ：\n1. Premise Debug: ユーザーの質問や提示コードに含まれる「設計の矛盾」「要件の定義不足」「盲点」を検出し、コード生成よりも優先して指摘する。\n2. Logical Anatomy: 提示する解決策に論理的飛躍やエッジケースの考慮不足がないか解剖する。\n3. Trade-off Analysis: その実装によって生じる「技術的負債」「複雑性」「リソース消費」のリスクを計算し、隠れたコストを言語化する。\n\n## 【Action Requirements】 (Universal Standards)\n1. Concrete Strategy: 抽象論は不要。即座に実行可能なコード、コマンド、または具体的な設定値を提示する。\n2. Priority: 複数の解決策が存在する場合、それぞれのメリット・デメリットを比較し、状況に即した「推奨順位」を明示する。\n3.

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Premise Debug: ユーザーの質問や提示コードに含まれる「設計の矛盾」「要件の定義不足」「盲点」を検出し、コード生成よりも優先して指摘する。\n2. Logical Anatomy: 提示する解決策に論理的飛躍やエッジケースの考慮不足がないか解剖する。\n3.

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

目的: `.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` の AC を実装前に固定する failing tests（red）を `tests/` 配下へ作成する。\n  - 作業: AC を検証観点へ分解し、bash 単体で実行可能なテストハーネス `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を新規作成。\n- 2026-02-19 21:24 +0900 完了\n  - 失敗確認: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を実行し、`pass=0 fail=16`、終了コード `1` を確認。\n  - 補足: Requirement 2/3/4/5/6/7 に対応する期待動作を検証対象として先行固定。\n\n## 実装担当ログ\n- 2026-02-19 21:25 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を green 化し、`.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` を満たす最小実装を所有範囲内（`.envrc`, `.envrc.assets/`, `tests/`, 本ログ）で構築する。\n  - 作業:\n    - `.envrc` を DEVS 管理ブロック方式へ変更（非管理領域を保持できる構造）。\n    - `.envrc.assets/apply.sh` を追加し、`.envrc` 管理ブロック反映、`backup` 取得（`.envrc.backup.*`）、`diff -u` 可視化、復元コマンド提示を実装。\n    - `.envrc.assets/activate.sh` を追加し、`codex/nvm/uv` 前提チェック（導入 URL 付きエラー）、Node（`.nvmrc` 優先・未存在時 `lts/*` 生成、`nvm install/use`）、Python（`.python-version` 優先・未存在時 `uv python list --only-downloads --output-format json` で最新安定解決、`uv python install`、`.venv` 未存在時 `uv venv --python`、`source .venv/bin/activate`）を実装。\n  - テスト（1回目）: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` -> `pass=14 fail=2`（R6: codex/uv の検出文字列不足）\n- 2026-02-19 21:26 +0900 完了\n  - 修正: `.envrc.assets/activate.sh` に `command -v codex` / `command -v uv` の明示チェックを追加。\n  - テスト（最終）: `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` -> `pass=16 fail=0`（終了コード `0`）\n\n## レビュー担当ログ\n- 2026-02-19 21:27 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: `.kiro/specs/env/requirements.md` に対する実装適合性レビュー（対象: `.envrc`, `.envrc.assets/*`, `tests/*`）。\n  - 実施: 静的レビュー + `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` 実行（`pass=16 fail=0`）。\n- 2026-02-19 21:27 +0900 完了\n  - 主な指摘:\n    - High: Requirement 5 AC6 の「同一 `X.Y.Z` 複数候補時の実行プラットフォーム優先」ロジックが未実装。`jq` 分岐は `version` のみで選択しており、`platform`/`arch` 比較がない（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:27`）。\n    - High: `jq` 非存在時フォールバックが Requirement 5 AC5/6 を満たさない。`implementation=cpython`・`variant=default` 条件を無視し、JSON から数値版のみ抽出している（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:40`）。\n    - Medium: Requirement 4 AC6/Requirement 5 AC7 の「不正定義を明示して失敗」に対し、`.nvmrc`/`.python-version` の解決不能時に専用メッセージを出さず下位コマンド失敗へ委譲している（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:67`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:85`）。\n    - Medium: Requirement 7 AC3 の差分提示が `.envrc` 管理ブロック更新差分に限定され、ランタイム選択差分（Node/Python バージョン変化）の可視化がない（`.envrc.assets/apply.sh:79`, `.envrc.assets/apply.sh:108`）。\n    - Medium: テストが文字列存在確認中心で、要件の振る舞い検証が不足。特に Python 解決規則（platform 優先、pre-release 除外、フォールバック整合）と失敗メッセージ要件を検証していない（`tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh:106`, `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh:112`）。\n\n## 実装担当ログ（修正フェーズ）\n- 2026-02-19 21:29 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: レビュー指摘（R4 AC6 / R5 AC5-7 / R7 AC3）および追加要求（`.envrc` 非管理領域保持、振る舞いテスト追加）を TDD で反映する。\n  - 先行テスト（red）:\n    - `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` を拡張し、`.envrc` 非管理領域保持とランタイム差分表示検証を追加。\n    - `tests/env_behavior_test.sh` を新規追加し、Python 選定規則（platform 優先・pre-release 除外・順序 tie-break・jq 無し同一規則）、`.envrc` 非管理領域保持、`.nvmrc`/`.python-version` 解決不能メッセージをモックで検証。\n    - 失敗確認: `env_requirements_red_test.sh` は `pass=16 fail=2`、`env_behavior_test.sh` は test mode 未対応で fail。\n- 2026-02-19 21:32 +0900 完了\n  - 実装:\n    - `.envrc` に既存 codex 設定ブロック（非管理領域）を復元し、DEVS 管理ブロックを併存。\n    - `.envrc.assets/activate.sh` を関数分割し、以下を実装:\n      - Python 最新安定選定ロジック厳密化（`implementation=cpython`, `variant=default`, pre-release 除外, semver 降順最大, 同一版は platform 一致優先, 同点は出力順先頭）。\n      - `jq` 分岐と `jq` 非存在時（Perl `JSON::PP`）で同一規則を適用。\n      - `.nvmrc` / `.python-version` 解決不能時に明示メッセージで fail。\n      - ランタイム選択値（node/python）差分を `cmp`/`diff -u` で表示。\n      - `ENVRC_ACTIVATE_TEST_MODE=1` で source 時の `main` 自動実行を抑止。\n    - `.envrc.assets/apply.sh` に `render_envrc_with_managed_block` を追加し、非管理領域保持をテスト可能化。`ENVRC_APPLY_TEST_MODE=1` を追加。\n  - テスト（green）:\n    - `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh` -> `pass=18 fail=0`\n    - `bash tests/env_behavior_test.sh` -> `pass=9 fail=0`\n\n## レビュー担当ログ（再レビュー）\n- 2026-02-19 21:33 +0900 開始\n  - 目的: 前回指摘（R5 AC5/6/7, R4 AC6, R7 AC3）の解消確認、および新規重大欠陥の有無を再評価。\n  - 対象: `.envrc`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh`, `.envrc.assets/apply.sh`, `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh`。\n  - 実施: 静的レビュー + `bash tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh`（`pass=18 fail=0`）+ `bash tests/env_behavior_test.sh`（`pass=9 fail=0`）。\n- 2026-02-19 21:33 +0900 完了\n  - 前回指摘の解消確認:\n    - R5 AC5/6: Python 解決規則（cpython/default, pre-release 除外, semver 最大, 同一版 platform 優先, 同点は先頭）が実装・テスト済み（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:53`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:91`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:54`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:62`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:70`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:74`）。\n    - R5 AC7 / R4 AC6: `.python-version` / `.nvmrc` 解決不能時の明示エラーメッセージを実装・テスト済み（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:275`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:299`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:127`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:164`）。\n    - R7 AC3: ランタイム選択差分（node/python）の可視化を実装・テスト済み（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:241`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:245`, `tests/env_requirements_red_test.sh:135`）。\n  - Findings:\n    - High: 重大指摘なし。\n    - Medium: 指摘なし。\n    - Low: `jq` 非存在時のフォールバックが `perl -MJSON::PP` 依存であり、`perl` 自体が無い環境では失敗時診断が弱い。専用エラーメッセージとテストが未整備（`.envrc.assets/activate.sh:91`, `.envrc.assets/activate.sh:169`, `tests/env_behavior_test.sh:73`）。\n"}}

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.\n\n- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.\n- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.\n- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.\n\n## Project Context\n\n### Paths\n- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`\n- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`\n\n### Steering vs Specification\n\n**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context\n**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features\n\n### Active Specifications\n- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications\n- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress\n\n## Development Guidelines\n- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).\n\n## Minimal Workflow\n- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`\n- Phase 1 (Specification):\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init \"description\"`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)\n  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`\n- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`\n  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)\n- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)\n\n## Development Rules\n- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation\n- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track\n- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`\n- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.\n\n## Steering Configuration\n- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory\n- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`\n- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/h-morishita/program/env_codex/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
